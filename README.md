1) According to data from the WHO, the diabetes condition is quickly spreading to epidemic proportions throughout the world. It can result in organ failure, cardiovascular illness, disruption of other body systems, and death if it is not successfully treated.

2) In order to stop the deadly disease's development, stakeholders in the health sector have been looking for machine learning (ML) technologies and approaches that can aid medical professionals in the early stage of diabetes diagnosis. The diagnosis of diabetes and other disorders in patients has recently been predicted by clinical trials using ML, data mining, and big data technologies.


3) Exploratory data analysis revealed significant class distribution skewness; to address this, the random under-sampling strategy was used with five Machine Learning (ML) models, including Random Forest.

4) Through the use of a classification report and confusion matrix, the models were assessed. Last but not least, the RF model achieved the highest accuracy score of 99%, followed by the DecisionTree, XGBoost, KNearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression models, each of which scored 98%, 97%, 80%, and 75%, respectively.
